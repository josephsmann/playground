# Delusions



## My Favourite Delusion

My favorite delusion is that malice is greatly over-estimated. That's it.

## Second Favorite Delusion

without providing better data literacy tools and actually using them in public
discourse, the challenge of bettering
our lot will be profound.

## Last Favorite Delusion
