I'm vain enough to have an "About Me" page.

I often like to think I have no "heros". To this end, I'd like to recognize:

- Jeremy Howard [@jerempyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for his fastai program, and the software for this blog, and his vision.

- Jake Vanderplas [@jakevdp](https://twitter.com/jakevdp?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) whose contributions to open data science have been essential to my
early interest and education in data science.

- Richard McElreath [@rlmcelreath](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for his Rethinking Statistics book and videos and sense of humour.

- [Russ Greiner](https://rgreiner6.wixsite.com/greiner) and the computational psychiatry group who let me pretend to be an academic while I had the time to do so.

I'll probably add more but I've got a real short/small memory/attention span.
