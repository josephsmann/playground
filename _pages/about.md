# Me.

I'm vain enough to have an "About Me" page.

I often think I have no "heros". To this end, I'd like to recognize:

- Jeremy Howard for his fastai program. and the software for this blog and his vision.
- Jake Vanderplas whose contributions to open data science have been essential to my
early interest and education in data science.
- Richard McElreath for his Rethinking Statistics book and videos and sense of humour.

I'll probably add more but I've got real short/small memory/attention span.
